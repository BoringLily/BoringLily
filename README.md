### Hi there üëã
#### My name is Lily,
- I currently work at Curtis Instruments, where I work on embedded motor control firmware and lead the development of a standalone device for CAN-based vehicle diagnostics and maintenance. 
#### My current fascinations and projects:
- Ergonomic keyboard design, and custom firmware as the existing options feel like a compromise.
- Computational Geometry such as parametric 3D CAD and 3D printer Slicer software.
## Here are some of the skills I have learned from work and personal curiosity:
