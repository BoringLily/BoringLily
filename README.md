### Hi there üëã
#### My name is Lily,
- At my job I work on embedded motor control firmware and I also lead the development for a new hardware tool, for both internal and customer use. 
- At home I work on many different projects that concern my many ideas and hobbies.
#### My current fascinations and projects:
- Ergonomic keyboard design, and custom firmware as the existing options feel like a compromise.
- Computational Geometry and how it relates to the design of CAD and Slicer software.
## Here are some of the skills I have learned from work and personal curiosity:
